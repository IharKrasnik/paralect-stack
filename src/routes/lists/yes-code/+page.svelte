				An error has occurred! <br />
				Dev Stack is still in beta. <br /><br />

				But you know what.. you can help us create the most decent modern tools library.<br /><br />
				See, we don't want to add thousands of tools here. Tech comes and ago. We want to list only battle-tested
				tech that really worth trying out.
				<br /><br />

				If you built something decent (we sure you are), submit your stack and get your beautiful
				page, that worth sharing. With your product link.

			Yes please don't be like the rest. It felt like they were in a race to list the most apps
			without putting too much thought into what they do or if they still exist. <br /> <br />I
			really like the approach you are taking and would like to help!
